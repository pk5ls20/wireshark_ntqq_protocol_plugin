### Support

- [X] incoming & outgoing uni TCP packet
- [X] incoming & outgoing Highway (TCP, HTTP) packet

### Usage

1. Manually compile git submodule [simple-crypto](https://github.com/pk5ls20/simple-crypto)
2. Manually compile [brimworks/lua-zlib](https://github.com/brimworks/lua-zlib) (and perhaps [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib) as well)
3. Place the compiled tea and zlib related library files into the directories specified by Lua's package.cpath
4. Place the lua scripts in the Wireshark personal lua scripts directory
5. Go to `Preferences -> Protocols -> NTQQ_PROTOCOL` to enter the required key in Wireshark
6. ~~Wireshark, launch!~~
